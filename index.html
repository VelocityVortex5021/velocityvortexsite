            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>
                Velocity Vortex is a high-performance team of student engineers
                and designers united by a passion for innovation and excellence.
                As competitors in STEM in Schools, we blend creativity,
                technical skill, and relentless problem-solving to push the
                boundaries of what’s possible in miniature race car design. Our
                team is driven by a shared commitment to precision,
                sustainability, and teamwork—values that define both our process
                and our results. From the drawing board to the race track, we
                strive to represent the future of engineering, one design at a
                time.

        <section class="what-we-do">
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
                At Velocity Vortex, we don’t just build cars—we engineer
                solutions. Our process begins with cutting-edge CAD design and
                aerodynamics modeling, ensuring every curve and component is
                optimized for speed, efficiency, and compliance with F1 in
                Schools regulations. We prototype, test, and refine our designs
                using advanced materials and manufacturing techniques,
                collaborating closely with mentors and industry professionals to
                bring our vision to life. Beyond the car, we focus on project
                management, branding, and community engagement. Our trade
                display and digital platforms—like this website—are designed to
                showcase not only our technical achievements but also the story
                behind our team: the challenges we’ve overcome, the skills we’ve
                developed, and the innovation that drives us forward. Whether
                it’s on the track or in the workshop, we’re always learning,
                adapting, and aiming for excellence.
