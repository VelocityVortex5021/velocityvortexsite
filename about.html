                        managing the finances and sponsorships. This also means
                        I will be in close conversation with all the sponsors
                        alongside our trade display manager (Riley) who also has
                        a background of sponsor management, ensuring you will
                        have some of the best service and communication when
                        sponsoring our team.

                        my passion for STEM in schools upon selecting the
                        subject as an elective for year 9 and later found it to
                        be a very fun and involving subject, which led to me
                        joining Velocity Vortex with other students in my class
                        who also share an interest in STEM in schools.

                        technology, also because I have a background of using

                        scratch. The display is our chance to showcase our

                        else we’ve worked on—all while maximizing points within
                        the competition’s rules. I’ve been deep into tech for
                        years—programming in Python, C, Typescript and Rust (to
                        mention a few), plus tinkering with Linux Distributions,
                        and even diving into a bit of ethical hacking. This
                        project lets me combine my skills in systems, security,
                        and web development to create something that’s not just
                        functional, but stands out technically and visually.
