                    I am a year 10 student, working as the team leader and finance manager in our team. I am responsible for making
sure everything is going right and helping others in the team when needed, though I put most of my focus
towards managing the finances and sponsorships. This also means I will be in close conversation with all the
sponsors alongside our trade display manager (Riley) who also has a background of sponsor management,
ensuring you will have some of the best service and communication when sponsoring our team.

                    I am Noah Cook as the Chief engineer in Velocity Vortex, my responsibility is to make the car and its parts. I discovered my passion for F1 in 2023. In 2024, I started participating in the "F1 in Schools" program. After enjoying making cars in class, I decided to continue with the program and saw the F1 in schools as an opportunity to further improve these skills, knowing this is a huge opportunity for me to compete with other students across the state I chose to join the team.

                    I am the second Engineer and responsible for testing the car and manufacturing the body and components of the car to make sure it fits the rules and regulations. I found my passion for F1 in schools upon selecting the subject as an elective for year 9 and later found it to be a very fun and involving subject, which led to me joining Velocity Vortex with other students in my class who also share an interest in F1 in schools.

Graphic Designer is because of my interest in art and technology, also because I have a background of using
many graphics software apps such as Adobe Lightroom (Digital Photography Software) as I do Aviation
photography. My roles are to design the main visuals and branding designs for our team, Velocity Vortex, and of
course helping out all the other members in the team when needed.

I am a year 10 student, and my role is to design and build the trade display, as well as program the website. The trade display showcases all of our work, including sponsors, the logo, information about us, portfolios, etc. The goal with the trade display is to get as many points as possible within regulations. Over the years I have gained knowledge in programming and coding, this allows me to create the website and proudly say that I have experience!
